Bike Lane Impact on Bike Usage and Pedestrian Accidents

Three separate cities, NYC, SF, and Chicago had data collected and organized into respective datasets. The prep can be found in the nyc-data-prep files and so forth.
The completed datasets for the three cities are marked with the city name and are the csv files uploaded.
The original source data used to create the respective city datasets were too large to upload and are referenced and linked in the final pdf document.

Using those files, the analyses were done. The first stage of this was done in the draft.rmd file and the bulk of the analysis was done in the final_draft.rmd file. 

The actual paper is the pdf called Final_Draft.
